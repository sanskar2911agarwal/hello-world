<p><h3>Effective Teams When setting up a team, the most important ingredient is the people. If the team is to function effectively, all the necessary skills and experience should be present and the people should have the authority to act on their own.  When a team starts working, it will need time and facilities to start their development and agree how they are going to operate. The purpose of the team must be clearly stated and written down in a document or manual.</h3> </p>

<p><h3>The type of team in the simulation is a Cross-Functional Task Force. I chose the Cross Functional Team because this will be a group of people working toward a common goal and made of people with different functional expertise.</h3></p>

<p><h3>I also think that Harvey Tang would be a great Creator; however two people will not make the cut. Janice Luikens is creative and single-minded, as well as excited, so she will be a good Promoter and Maintainer. I chose Marcell Collins for the Linker and Producer role. He seems to be a great team player and I also liked the compliments his colleagues gave him about keeping them from getting off track and helping them to maintain their focus.</h3></p>
